This blog records the insight for discussing the NTG and water saturation affecting the fragments. Net to Gross (NTG)We draw the different colour OIP curve to discriminate NTG genes and conclude that the NTG genes influence the range of OIP values. The figure displays the 24 different colours dots separating vertically as bars, representing the 24 NTG genes. Each bar has different maximum and minimum OIP values but a similar distribution. We, therefore, assume that the NTG gene affects the range of the group of OIP values. Water saturation (Sw)The water saturation mostly affect the OIP value as the figure below showing. The OIP values from the models with the same Sw gene (the same colour) show the approximate consistency. OverallIn conclusion, we have known the way of model’s genes affecting the OIP values. However, we should not see these insights in the task since, in the scenario, we do not know the OIP value, and we only have the genes. So we should focus on analysing the variables from the genes to see if there is consistency with OIP value. Hopefully, we can get a proper unsupervised grouping metrics from it.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"MSc project","slug":"MSc-project","permalink":"https://ruibinwong.com/tags/MSc-project/"}]},{"title":"MSc project research journey - OIP investigation 1","slug":"MSc-project-research-journey-OIP-investigation-1","date":"2020-05-08T18:41:16.000Z","updated":"2020-05-13T00:56:03.863Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/05/08/MSc-project-research-journey-OIP-investigation-1/","link":"","permalink":"https://ruibinwong.com/2020/05/08/MSc-project-research-journey-OIP-investigation-1/","excerpt":"","text":"OIP investigation 1We tried to explore the OIP value curve from Phi, NTG and Water Saturation. We found a proper division method that treating the OIP plotted by 24 Phi genes as a fragment, and these fragments could show a similar level of OIP (as the figure showing below). NTG and Water Saturation decide the positions of fragments on the figure. These positions reflect the different level of OIP, which is what we are expecting. We should do further exploration of NTG and Water Saturation to see how they influence the fragments’ positions. Now we can be sure these genes are really affecting the OIP.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"MSc project","slug":"MSc-project","permalink":"https://ruibinwong.com/tags/MSc-project/"}]}],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"MSc project","slug":"MSc-project","permalink":"https://ruibinwong.com/tags/MSc-project/"}]}
