We found a proper division method that treating the OIP plotted by 24 Phi genes as a fragment, and these fragments could show a similar level of OIP (as the figure showing below). NTG and Water Saturation decide the positions of fragments on the figure. These positions reflect the different level of OIP, which is what we are expecting. We should do further exploration of NTG and Water Saturation to see how they influence the fragmentsâ€™ positions. Now we can be sure these genes are really affecting the OIP.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"data investigation","slug":"data-investigation","permalink":"https://ruibinwong.com/tags/data-investigation/"}]}],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"data investigation","slug":"data-investigation","permalink":"https://ruibinwong.com/tags/data-investigation/"}]}
